# python-challenge

## PyBank 
For this challenge, I analyzed the financial records of my company. After creating a path and opening my csv file, I was able to iterate through each row to find the total number of months that were included in my dataset as well as the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period. I had to set variables and create empty lists before iterating through the rows in my script. I put my analysis in a list to print out the results of my script and later export to a text file. These are the results:

## PyPoll
Similar to the PyBank challenge, I analyzed the votes for a small, rural town to modernize its vote-counting process in the PyPoll challenge. I created an empty dictionary to store votes for each candidate and variables for the total votes. After creating a path and opening my csv file, I iterated through each row to find the total number of votes cast and a list of all candidates that recieved votes. For each candidate, my script found the percentage of votes they won and the total number of votes to determine the winner based on popular vote. I created an empty list to store my analysis and used the built- in method 'append' to add the results of my script to the list. These are the results:

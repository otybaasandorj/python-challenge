# python-challenge

## PyBank 
For this challenge, I analyzed the financial records of my company. After creating a path and opening my csv file, I was able to iterate through each row to find the total number of months that were included in my dataset as well as the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period. I had to set variables and create empty lists before iterating through the rows in my script. I put my analysis in a list to print out the results of my script and later export to a text file.
